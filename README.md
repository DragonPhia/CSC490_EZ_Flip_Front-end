This is the front-end portion of mobile application 'EZ Flip'. We are creating this app because many sellers 
either on eBay or on other platforms juggle multiple tools to track inventory and calculate profits. This 
mobile application allows users to be able to analyze sell-through rates, average prices, price trends 
and general sales.â€‹ As well as track inventory, calculate profits, and sync data to spreadsheets for quick 
analysis and calculations.
